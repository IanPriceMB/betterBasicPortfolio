                <p>I am a full-stack web developer fluent in the MERN stack. My favorite coding languages and skills are: jQuery, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, MySQL, React.js, Node.js, Sequelize, Passport.js, Handlebars, CSS and HTML5.

                    I fell sideways into coding after playing Heroes of the Storm professionally for various organizations, and I absolutely love it! It is really fun and satisfying to create websites. I take deep pride in knowing that the skills I have are being used in ways that help to make life better for the people who are using the sites that I take a part in building, and it’s this feeling that compels me to always do my best work on all of my projects.

                    If you’re looking for an exciting, hard working, skilled, young, developer to work on your project than you’ve found the right guy.
